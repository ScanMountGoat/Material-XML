<a href="url"><img src="application.png" align="top" height="auto" width="auto" ></a>   
A QT GUI application for analyzing XML materials exported from [Smash Forge](https://github.com/jam1garner/Smash-Forge).
A dump of XML material files for most of the models in Smash 4 for Wii U can be
found [here](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Sm4sh-Material-Research/blob/master/XML%20Materials/Smash%20XML%20Materials.7z). UI design not final and subject to change. For bugs or feature suggestions, please use the [Issues page](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smash-Material-XML/issues).

## Usage Guide
The application maintains a single list of xml materials. Each search creates a filtered list of materials based on the search settings used. Not specifying any search settings will include all materials.

### Main Toolbar
**File > Add material from file:** all the materials in the selected XML file will be added to the
materials list.  
**File > Add material from folder:** all the materials in all XML files in the selected directory,
including all subdirectories, will be added to the materials list.  
**Clear materials:** all materials previously added to the materials list will be removed.  
**View > About:** displays a link to the license information.

### Search Settings  
Flags values are 8 digit hexadecimal numbers. 

## Credits
